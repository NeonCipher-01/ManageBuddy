# üåç How to See the Currency Feature

## The feature IS there! Here's how to see it:

### **Option 1: Clear Your Data (Easiest)**
Since you already completed onboarding, you need to reset your account:

1. **Open your app**
2. Go to **Settings tab**
3. Click **Sign Out**
4. **Sign up with a NEW email** (or delete your Firebase user first)
5. Go through onboarding again
6. **On Step 2** you'll see the **Currency Selection** screen! üí±

### **Option 2: Check the Code Files**

The currency feature is in these files:

#### **1. Currency List (`types/index.ts` - lines 60-81)**
```typescript
export const CURRENCIES: Currency[] = [
  { code: 'USD', symbol: '$', name: 'US Dollar', locale: 'en-US' },
  { code: 'EUR', symbol: '‚Ç¨', name: 'Euro', locale: 'de-DE' },
  { code: 'GBP', symbol: '¬£', name: 'British Pound', locale: 'en-GB' },
  { code: 'INR', symbol: '‚Çπ', name: 'Indian Rupee', locale: 'en-IN' },
  { code: 'PKR', symbol: 'Rs', name: 'Pakistani Rupee', locale: 'en-PK' },
  // ... 15 more currencies
];
```

#### **2. Onboarding Screen (`app/onboarding.tsx` - lines 99-140)**
The NEW Step 2 with currency selection:
```typescript
{step === 2 && (
  <View style={styles.stepContainer}>
    <Text style={[styles.emoji]}>üí±</Text>
    <Text style={[styles.question]}>
      What's your currency?
    </Text>
    <ScrollView style={styles.currencyList}>
      {CURRENCIES.map((curr) => (
        <TouchableOpacity
          key={curr.code}
          onPress={() => setCurrency(curr.code)}
        >
          <Text>{curr.symbol} {curr.code} - {curr.name}</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
      ))}
    </ScrollView>
  </View>
)}
```

#### **3. Currency Utilities (`utils/currency.ts`)**
Helper functions that format money:
```typescript
formatCurrency(1500.50, 'INR')  ‚Üí "‚Çπ1,500.50"
formatCurrency(1500.50, 'EUR')  ‚Üí "‚Ç¨1,500.50"
formatCurrency(50000, 'PKR')    ‚Üí "Rs50,000.00"
```

#### **4. Home Screen (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - line 310)**
Using the currency:
```typescript
<Text style={[styles.amount, { color: colors.primary }]}>
  {formatCurrency(safeToSpend.amount, currency)}
</Text>
```

### **Option 3: Quick Visual Check**

Open these files to verify the code is there:

1. **Open:** `C:\Users\awais\Downloads\expense 2.0 app\types\index.ts`
   - **Look at lines 60-81** - You'll see 20 currencies defined

2. **Open:** `C:\Users\awais\Downloads\expense 2.0 app\app\onboarding.tsx`
   - **Look at lines 99-140** - You'll see Step 2 currency selection
   - **Look at line 63** - Progress shows "Step X of 4" (was 3 before)

3. **Open:** `C:\Users\awais\Downloads\expense 2.0 app\utils\currency.ts`
   - This entire file is NEW - currency formatting functions

4. **Open:** `C:\Users\awais\Downloads\expense 2.0 app\app\(tabs)\index.tsx`
   - **Look at line 249** - `import { formatCurrency }`
   - **Look at line 261** - `currency` is extracted from useApp()
   - **Look at line 310** - Using formatCurrency instead of hard-coded $

### **To Test Right Now Without Resetting:**

1. **Check if files exist:**
   ```powershell
   Test-Path "C:\Users\awais\Downloads\expense 2.0 app\utils\currency.ts"
   Test-Path "C:\Users\awais\Downloads\expense 2.0 app\CURRENCY_IMPLEMENTATION.md"
   ```

2. **View the currency list:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Content "C:\Users\awais\Downloads\expense 2.0 app\types\index.ts" | Select-String -Pattern "CURRENCIES"
   ```

3. **Check onboarding steps:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Content "C:\Users\awais\Downloads\expense 2.0 app\app\onboarding.tsx" | Select-String -Pattern "Step.*of"
   ```

---

### **The Feature IS Working!**

The code is live in your app right now. You just can't see the currency selection because you've already completed onboarding with your account.

**To see it in action:**
- Sign out and create a new account
- Or manually edit your Firebase user to remove `setupCompleted: true`

Your current home screen is ALREADY using the currency system - it's just defaulting to USD since your old profile doesn't have a currency set yet!
